Note from Bernhard Schlegel: I was not able to get it working with any of the
versions available in the platformIO package Repo (as of March 2021 0.16.0 and 0.15.0).

Since WiFi manager is undergoing massive reworks, I decided to ship the version 
I was using (e.g. offering `saveParamCallback()`) as ZIP file. This is supposedly 
version `2.0.4-beta`.
